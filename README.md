[ Add-on Code : ```1677779223``` ]


## 1. Various Pokemanki

This Pokemanki Gold is the third version on AnkiWeb and is based on Zjosua's Pokemanki_v1.3.0. If this Pokemanki Gold does not work well, try them. <br>
1. [Pokemanki (Original) ](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/633922407) / [Author : BlueGreenMagick](https://ko-fi.com/bluegreenmagick) ▲It seems that it has not been updated since 2021. Works fine with Anki 2.1.48.
1. [Pokémanki (Second) ](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1041307953) / [Author : Zjosua](https://github.com/zjosua) ★The most developed and regularly updated. Works fine with the latest Anki.

Pokemanki uses [Libaddon](https://github.com/glutanimate/anki-libaddon/) by [Glutanimate](https://glutanimate.com/tip-jar/). <br>

## 2. Purpose of developing this add-on <br>
When I asked for ideas for gamification add-ons on Reddit, there was a request to fix Pokemanki. At the moment, I am testing the addition of prototype features to see if they work properly.

## 3. Q & A

#### Q. How do I access my pokemon?<br>
A. Try go to "State" and press "collection" instead of "deck".<br>

#### Q. I cannot select my first Pokémon.<br>
A. Try setting Pokemanki to tags instead of decks, maybe it will work.<br>
* Tools -> Decks vs Tags -> Tags<br>
